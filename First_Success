from SpacecraftSim import SpacecraftEngine

'''
Spacecraft Engine API:

myRocket.getData(): 
inputs: none
outputs: an array with position, velocity, and acceleration as the first, second, and third elements.

myRocket.update():
inputs: none
outputs: none
purpose: Gets a new set of position, velocity, and acceleration for each loop.

myRocket.setThrust(signal):
inputs: thrust (percent of maximum) as a signal from 0 - 100
outputs: none
purpose: Sets the thrust of the engine 

myRocket.checkCrashStatus():
inputs: none
outputs: True or False indicating whether or not the rocket has crashed. This occurs if the rocket hits the ground with a velocity greater than 1.5 m/s.

myRocket.checkLandingStatus():
inputs: none
outputs: True or False indicating whether or not the rocket has landed. This occurs if the rocket's height hits Zero

myRocket.getLandingVel():
inputs: none
outputs: speed of the rocket upon landing.
